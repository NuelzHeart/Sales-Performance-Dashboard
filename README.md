## Project Overview
This project features an interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard built using a McDonald's sales dataset. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about revenue performance, product trends, customer behavior, and geographic distribution.
It demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into a decision-ready analytics dashboard.

## Purpose of the Project
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Clean and analyze raw sales data
- Build meaningful visualizations
- Transform business objectives into a functional dashboard
- Present insights that support decision-making

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Which products generated the highest revenue
- Which city has the highest sales
- Which manager handled the most sales transactions 
- What is the most commonly purchased type 
- What is the most used payment method 
- Which day has the most sales
- How does sales volume change over time 
- Are there certain managers who perform better in specific cities
- Is there a particular product that sells more in a specific country

## Data Processing Required
- Generated a matching country for each city using lookup formulas
- Calculated revenue for each transaction
- Classified transactions into high, fair, and low sales categories
- Extracted months and days from the date column
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight revenue patterns
  
## Key Performance Indicators
- Total Revenue
- Total Units Sold
- Total Transactions
- Average Price

## Dashboard Analysis
The dashboard analyzes:
- Revenue distribution by city
- Revenue distribution by products
- Manager insights and geographic revenue distribution
- Daily/periodic sales trend/volume
- Comparisons of purchase types and payment methods

## Project Insights
- Sales are driven mainly by core fast-food products such as Burgers, which contribute the highest revenue.
- London and Lisbon appear to be the strongest-performing cities, indicating higher customer activity and stronger branch performance.
- Managers associated with these cities, such as Tom Jackson and Joao Silva, generated the most revenue.
- Credit Cards are frequently used payment methods, reflecting strong engagement with digital channels.
- Online purchases outperform in-store purchases, showing stronger digital engagement and higher sales through online channels.

## Recommendations Summary
- Boost marketing efforts in low-performing cities like Paris and Berlin to improve overall revenue distribution.
- Expand and bundle high-demand products to maximize revenue from best-selling items.
- Strengthen the online purchasing experience further, since it already performs strongly, by introducing exclusive deals and faster checkout options.
- Use top-performing managers as models for training and performance improvement across other locations.
