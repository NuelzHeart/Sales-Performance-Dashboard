# Sales Analysis Dashboard 

This project presents an interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard built using the McDonald's dataset. The goal is to provide clear, data-driven insights into sales performance, revenue patterns, profitability, and geographic distribution.

The dashboard highlights key trends that help businesses understand product performance, sales channels, payment behavior, and operational efficiency.

## Purpose of the Project
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Clean and analyze raw sales data
- Build meaningful visualizations
- Transform business objectives into a functional dashboard
- Present insights that support decision-making

## Data Processing Required
- Using the F statement, generate the matching country for the city. 
- Find the revenue for each sales
- Determine which sales fall into high sales, fair sales, and low sales
- Extract the month from your date
- Extract the days of the week from your date
- Apply any conditional formatting of your choice to revenue

## Objectives
- Which products generated the highest revenue
- Which city has the highest sales
- Which manager handled the most sales transactions 
- What is the most commonly purchased type 
- What is the most used payment method 
- Which day has the most sales
- How does sales volume change over time 
- Are there certain managers who perform better in specific cities
- Is there a particular product that sells more in a specific country

## Key Performance Indicators
- Total Revenue
- Total Units Sold
- Total Transactions
- Average Price

## Project Overview
The dashboard analyzes:
- Revenue distribution by city
- Revenue distribution by products
- Manager insights and geographic revenue distribution
- Daily/periodic sales trend/volume
- Comparisons of purchase types and payment methods

## Project Insights
- Sales are driven mainly by core fast-food products such as Burgers, which contribute the highest revenue.
- London and Lisbon appear to be the strongest-performing cities, indicating higher customer activity and stronger branch performance.
- Managers associated with these cities, such as Tom Jackson and Joao Silva, generated the most revenue.
- Credit Cards are frequently used payment methods, reflecting strong engagement with digital channels.
- Online purchases outperform in-store purchases, showing stronger digital engagement and higher sales through online channels.

## Recommendations Summary
- Boost marketing efforts in low-performing cities like Paris and Berlin to improve overall revenue distribution.
- Expand and bundle high-demand products to maximize revenue from best-selling items.
- Strengthen the online purchasing experience further, since it already performs strongly, by introducing exclusive deals and faster checkout options.
- Use top-performing managers as models for training and performance improvement across other locations.
